You are tall and strong â€”
huge and dark,
green and blue.

I can hear
the laugh and the tear,
so calm,
yet seeming far and lonely.

Though in the crowd,
fully filled,
there is nothing.

Your preachings echo,
but my understanding
isnâ€™t sinking in.

Maybe Iâ€™m blind,
and you showed light.

The feeling overflows
with no words to share â€”
it stumbles, it aches,
yet stillâ€¦
you are my bliss. ðŸŒ™
