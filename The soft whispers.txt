The day and the night passes, 
The rain falls and the water flows,
But here I'm  struck between pages.
It's said false are the fairytales,
It wasn't innocent but fool made of
Seen and heard but not realised
The last petal left also withered.

The morning was cold and chill... 
The firstday of the year when I turned the fan down. 
The sun blissfully played with dews then he looked at the moon standing before her likely waiting for him to see her.
They both chiseled poetry of eachother and the sky froze for them and did my time.
Somehow it was forbidden.
But the time they stood , was real.
