They say trees have life.
But is it the tree—
or the leaves,
and the branches?

If it’s only the tree,
then what are the leaves for?
They shine,
they fall,
they change.
Why?

From twig to hay,
they live and die in silence.
If it’s only the tree,
then why the trunk,
why the roots that hold,
why the green that breathes?

Maybe it’s not the tree alone,
but all of it—
each leaf, each branch,
each unseen root—
that becomes life together.

And if a feather
can tell the story of a bird,
then maybe
a leaf
can whisper the story of a tree.
