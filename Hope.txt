There is something which everyone knows,
   This is for some who don't have those.
Can't you bear the pain and fire the few,
   Can't you hear him calling you.
At the time, you are defeated by your foe,
   At the time you are kicked by their toe.
If you are not means you are very low,
   Don't worry ,you can glow.
He resides within your heart,
   He plays a very important part.
You must wake him up,
   Are you will find everything tough.
When you are used for rough,
   When you are rolled like a Dough.
Now lend an ear, he'll bake
   Not you but your foe into a cake.
When the time is hard,
   That's the play of the Lord.
You may think you're hexed,
   That's a play to make you vexed.
Are you in dark with hope alone,
   No worry-you'll rise like balloon
He'll take you to moon,
   You'll be successful soon.
Do you want to know what's your gain
   You'll say,"it's fine to live with pain."
He'll let you climb as he is a rope,
   Yup... It's Hope
