There was a new, bright green leaf on a large tree. The tree was huge, giving all its love and care to the leaves and fruits, making the whole tree a blessing.

This new leaf had a dream. She wanted to see more of the world around her. She yearned to be on the highest point, to see the whole world together. She decided to fly with the wind.

In one strong blow of the wind, she left her tree and flew away. It took her to a place she'd never seen. She fell on the ground, but the wind picked her up again, moving her farther and farther.

Some nights were dark for the leaf after she left the tree. Other days, the sun was too hot; her clear color and strength faded. Now, it was not a joy to hop on the wind. The ground beneath her seemed to slip away.

She saw only a collection of dark, toiling things in the scorching heat. And one thing that broke her was the pain she felt for the tree, and the pain she caused it by leaving. Yet, she found peaceful, grateful nights seeing the movement of things. She was dry now, only a few parts left before she withered.

Finally, she fell on a bank and the water took her. She was floating. She didn't know the world underwater, nor the world above. She simply was in the water.

She was floating in the river when she was carried over a great cliff. She fell from a great height into the water and was not seen again.
