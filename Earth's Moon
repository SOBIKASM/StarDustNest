Everybody looks at the moon
and praises his shining beam.

If he could think,
he might wonder—
there are other moons out there,
bigger, brighter,
alive with oceans and skies.

Yet we do not love them.
If only they were here,
perhaps we’d be happier, stronger,
certain of more.

Maybe he thinks
he doesn’t deserve our love.
But to the eyes of Earth,
he is the most beautiful one.

So, somebody tell him—
tell the moon—
that he is already
and always has been
very special.
