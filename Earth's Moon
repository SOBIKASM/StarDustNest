Everybody looks at the moon,
and praises his shining beam.

He sits there, silent,
so far away —
and maybe he wonders.

Maybe he thinks,
“There are other moons out there…
Bigger. Brighter. Mayeven support life.”

And he’s right —
there are.
Worlds of light,
moons that could hold life,
moons that never go dark.

But none of them
have us.

None of them
have a Earth full of people
who wait for them to rise.

If only, he might think,
if only they were here instead of me —
The Earth and its people 
would be happier, stronger,
sure of more.

Maybe he thinks
he doesn’t deserve our love.

But in the eyes of Earth,
he is the only one.
The most beautiful one.

So somebody tell him.
Tell him he’s enough.
Tell him he’s already special.
Tell him—
he always was.
