“If I were a bird, I could fly.”
Yes, birds can fly.
But you are not a bird. You cannot fly.
You cannot become a bird — you are human.

Birds are born to fly.
You were not born as a bird.
So how can one who is born human
dream of being born as a bird,
when that life has already been lived?

Birds can fly because they are made to.
You cannot, because you are not.
You could fly if you became a bird —
but you cannot become one,
because you already are human.
And so, if humans cannot become birds,
they cannot fly.
