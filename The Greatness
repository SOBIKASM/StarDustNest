Little things
see little things
with great meaning.

Tiny ants
crawling over cracks in a wall.

Big things
see big things
with great meaning.

Humans
crossing oceans,chasing horizons.

The meaning of greatness
stays the same â€”
only the scale is different.

Some are cracks on a wall,
some are lines of boundary across the ocean and land.

Yet, what can I fill for the yet
when the life is justifically unfair.
