Life is something God rules with we fools;
    Lots of little ones fail with childhood
Lately Lavender , a little girl stood!
     Loved everyone, she seemed so cool.

On a good day , there comes a play
     Omitting her from the list of joy
Offended her and made her a toy.
     Overgrown humans are not worthy to say!
     
Version of victim,she knew it won't suit her
     Victory are for the one who wants.
Vexed one came back, together with broken parts.
      Violent storm in her raised,to be against those sir

"Escaping the problem won't solve any.
      Everyone are strong enough to fight;
Eternal means are with you so tight.
     Eliminate the pain,Go... evoke yourself"

Having a thought of winning
    Hasted her power of fighting!
Humbly believing girl faded
    Heroic deeds came of her vaulted!

Exposed herself and like lightning.
    Experiencing the dark raised her worth,
Exceeded and dumped the ones down to Earth.
     Exported one is her, cooly winding

Rare one like her is here ,seek;
     Reading the draft of Lavender.
Risking with sense will reap:
     Refuse the hates,Go make everyone surrender!
 
    A flower named fighter is "her"
